# Persistent Authentication Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides persistent authentication for the CampusConnect application, allowing users to stay logged in until they explicitly log out, even after closing and reopening the browser.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Session Management (`src/utils/sessionUtils.ts`)
- **Removed automatic session timeout**: The 24-hour automatic timeout has been removed
- **Persistent authentication**: Users now stay logged in until they explicitly log out
- **Simplified session validation**: Only checks if user is authenticated, no time-based expiration

### 2. Authentication Middleware (`src/components/AuthMiddleware.tsx`)
- **Automatic redirection**: Authenticated users are automatically redirected to their appropriate dashboard when visiting the home page
- **Role-based routing**: Routes users to `/admin`, `/office`, or `/student` based on their role

### 3. Protected Route Component (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- **Centralized authentication**: Handles authentication and role-based access control for all protected routes
- **Loading states**: Provides consistent loading experience during authentication checks
- **Automatic redirects**: Redirects unauthorized users to the home page

### 4. Layout Updates
- **Admin Layout** (`src/app/admin/layout.tsx`): Now uses ProtectedRoute for authentication
- **Student Layout** (`src/app/student/layout.tsx`): Now uses ProtectedRoute for authentication  
- **Office Layout** (`src/app/office/layout.tsx`): New layout file with ProtectedRoute

### 5. Home Page Updates (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- **AuthMiddleware integration**: Automatically redirects authenticated users to their dashboard
- **Improved user experience**: Users don't see the login page if already authenticated

## How It Works

### Login Flow
1. User enters access code on home page
2. System validates access code and determines user role
3. Session data is stored in localStorage (no expiration)
4. User is redirected to appropriate dashboard

### Persistent Session
1. When user closes browser and reopens, session data remains in localStorage
2. AuthMiddleware checks for existing session on home page visit
3. If authenticated, user is automatically redirected to their dashboard
4. No need to re-enter access code

### Logout Flow
1. User clicks logout button in dashboard
2. Session data is cleared from localStorage
3. User is redirected to home page
4. User must re-enter access code to access dashboard again

## Access Codes
- **Admin/Professor**: `PROFESSOR2024`
- **Office**: `OFFICE2024`
- **Student**: `STUDENT2024`

## Security Features
- **Role-based access control**: Users can only access pages appropriate for their role
- **Session validation**: All protected routes validate authentication and role
- **Automatic cleanup**: Invalid sessions are automatically cleared
- **Explicit logout**: Users must explicitly log out to end their session

## Benefits
- **Improved user experience**: No need to re-enter access code on each visit
- **Persistent sessions**: Users stay logged in across browser sessions
- **Secure logout**: Only explicit logout ends the session
- **Role-based security**: Maintains proper access control
- **Automatic redirection**: Seamless navigation for authenticated users
